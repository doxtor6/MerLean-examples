      "proof": "We verify each type of operator becomes a stabilizer and that the dimension count is correct.\n\n**Part 1: $A_v$ operators become stabilizers.**\n\nThe $A_v$ operators are explicitly measured during the gauging procedure. By the measurement postulate of quantum mechanics, after measuring $A_v$ with outcome $\\varepsilon_v \\in \\{+1, -1\\}$, the state is projected into the $\\varepsilon_v$-eigenspace of $A_v$. By tracking outcomes (or applying conditional Pauli corrections $X_v$ when $\\varepsilon_v = -1$), we can ensure the code is in the $+1$ eigenspace of all $A_v$. Therefore, each $A_v$ is a stabilizer of the deformed code.\n\n**Part 2: $B_p$ operators are stabilizers.**\n\nWe show $B_p$ stabilizes the state in two steps:\n\n**Step 2a: Initial eigenvalue is $+1$.** Initially, edge qubits are in state $|0\\rangle^{\\otimes E_G}$. For any edge $e$, we have $Z_e|0\\rangle_e = (+1)|0\\rangle_e$ because $|0\\rangle$ is the $+1$ eigenstate of $Z$. Therefore, for any cycle $p$, we compute:\n$$B_p|0\\rangle^{\\otimes E_G} = \\left(\\prod_{e \\in p} Z_e\\right)|0\\rangle^{\\otimes E_G} = \\left(\\prod_{e \\in p} (+1)\\right)|0\\rangle^{\\otimes E_G} = (+1)|0\\rangle^{\\otimes E_G}$$\n\n**Step 2b: $B_p$ commutes with all $A_v$.** To verify $[B_p, A_v] = 0$, we count anticommuting pairs of operators. The only potential anticommutations arise between $Z_e$ factors of $B_p$ and $X_e$ factors of $A_v$. The operator $A_v = X_v \\prod_{e \\ni v} X_e$ contains $X_e$ for each edge $e$ incident to $v$.\n\nNow, how many edges of cycle $p$ are incident to vertex $v$? Consider two cases:\n- If $v \\notin p$ (vertex not on the cycle): No edges of $p$ are incident to $v$, so 0 anticommutations.\n- If $v \\in p$ (vertex on the cycle): Exactly 2 edges of $p$ are incident to $v$ (the two edges entering and leaving $v$ along the cycle), so 2 anticommutations.\n\nIn both cases, the number of anticommutations is even. Since each anticommutation contributes a factor of $(-1)$, the total sign is $(-1)^{\\text{even}} = +1$, meaning $B_p A_v = A_v B_p$.\n\nSince $B_p$ has initial eigenvalue $+1$ and commutes with all measured operators $A_v$, it remains a stabilizer of the deformed code.\n\n**Part 3: $\\tilde{s}_j$ operators are stabilizers.**\n\nWe show that $\\tilde{s}_j = s_j \\prod_{e \\in \\gamma_j} Z_e$ commutes with all $A_v$ operators.\n\n**Step 3a: Counting anticommutations.** For a fixed vertex $v$, we count how many anticommuting pairs arise between $\\tilde{s}_j$ and $A_v$:\n\n- From $s_j$: The operator $s_j$ contains a $Z_v$ factor if and only if $v \\in \\mathcal{S}_{Z,j}$ (the Z-type support of $s_j$). If $v \\in \\mathcal{S}_{Z,j} \\cap V_G$, then $Z_v$ anticommutes with $X_v$ in $A_v$, contributing 1 anticommutation.\n\n- From $\\prod_{e \\in \\gamma_j} Z_e$: Each $Z_e$ with $v \\in e$ (edge incident to $v$) anticommutes with $X_e$ in $A_v$. The number of such edges equals $(\\partial \\gamma_j)_v$ (the $v$-component of the boundary of $\\gamma_j$, which counts edges in $\\gamma_j$ incident to $v$ modulo 2).\n\n**Step 3b: Boundary condition ensures cancellation.** By definition of $\\gamma_j$, we have $\\partial \\gamma_j = \\mathcal{S}_{Z,j} \\cap V_G$. Therefore:\n- $(\\partial \\gamma_j)_v = 1$ if and only if $v \\in \\mathcal{S}_{Z,j} \\cap V_G$.\n\nThis means the number of anticommutations from $s_j$ (which is 1 if $v \\in \\mathcal{S}_{Z,j} \\cap V_G$, else 0) exactly equals the number from $\\prod_{e \\in \\gamma_j} Z_e$ (which is $(\\partial \\gamma_j)_v$). The total number of anticommutations is therefore:\n$$1_{v \\in \\mathcal{S}_{Z,j} \\cap V_G} + (\\partial \\gamma_j)_v = 2 \\cdot 1_{v \\in \\mathcal{S}_{Z,j} \\cap V_G} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$$\n\nSince the total is even, we have $[\\tilde{s}_j, A_v] = 0$ for all $v$.\n\n**Step 3c: Initial eigenvalue.** The original stabilizer $s_j$ has eigenvalue $+1$ on the code state. The edge operators $Z_e$ each have eigenvalue $+1$ on the initial $|0\\rangle_e$ state. Therefore:\n$$\\tilde{s}_j |\\psi\\rangle|0\\rangle^{\\otimes E_G} = s_j|\\psi\\rangle \\cdot \\prod_{e \\in \\gamma_j}(+1)|0\\rangle^{\\otimes E_G} = (+1)|\\psi\\rangle|0\\rangle^{\\otimes E_G}$$\n\nSo $\\tilde{s}_j$ has initial eigenvalue $+1$ and remains a stabilizer.\n\n**Part 4: Dimension count.**\n\nOriginal system: $n$ qubits, $(n - k)$ independent stabilizers, code space dimension $2^k$.\n\nDeformed system:\n- Qubits: $n + |E_G|$ (original qubits plus edge qubits).\n- New X-type stabilizers from $A_v$: There are $|V_G|$ operators $A_v$, but they satisfy one relation: $\\prod_{v \\in V_G} A_v = L \\cdot \\prod_e X_e^2 = L$ (since $X_e^2 = I$). So $(|V_G| - 1)$ are independent, plus the logical $L$ is now a stabilizer.\n- New Z-type stabilizers from $B_p$: There are $C = |E_G| - |V_G| + 1$ independent cycles (by Euler's formula for connected graphs), giving $C$ independent $B_p$ operators.\n- Original stabilizers become $\\tilde{s}_j$: $(n - k)$ operators.\n\nTotal independent stabilizers:\n$$(|V_G| - 1 + 1) + (|E_G| - |V_G| + 1) + (n - k) = |E_G| + (n - k) + 1$$\n\nThe $+1$ accounts for the logical $L$ becoming a stabilizer. Code space dimension:\n$$2^{(n + |E_G|) - (|E_G| + n - k + 1)} = 2^{k-1}$$\n\nThis confirms exactly one logical qubit (corresponding to $L$) has been measured.",

Consider the commutator $[L', B_p]$. Since $B_p = \\prod_{e \\in p} Z_e$ consists only of $Z_e$ operators, the only part of $L'$ that can anticommute is the $X_e$ part, namely $L_X^E$.\n\nFor each edge $e \\in p$, if $e \\in \\mathcal{S}_X^E$ (meaning $L_X^E$ contains $X_e$), then $X_e$ anticommutes with $Z_e$. So:\n$$[L_X^E, B_p] = (-1)^{|p \\cap \\mathcal{S}_X^E|} \\text{ (meaning they anticommute if the intersection has odd size)}$$\n\nFor $L'$ to commute with all $B_p$, we need $|p \\cap \\mathcal{S}_X^E| \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$ for all cycles $p$. This exactly means $\\mathcal{S}_X^E$ is a 1-cocycle: $\\delta_2 \\mathcal{S}_X^E = 0$.\n\n**Step 3: Cocycle is a coboundary.**\n\nSince the $B_p$ operators are defined on a generating set of cycles, the sequence formed by $\\delta, \\delta_2$ is exact (see Rem_7). This means $\\ker(\\delta_2) = \\text{im}(\\delta)$. Since $\\mathcal{S}_X^E \\in \\ker(\\delta_2)$, there exists a vertex set $\\tilde{\\mathcal{S}}_X^V \\subseteq V_{\\bar{\\bar{G}}}$ such that:\n$$\\mathcal{S}_X^E = \\delta \\tilde{\\mathcal{S}}_X^V$$\n\nIn other words, the edges in $\\mathcal{S}_X^E$ are exactly those crossing the cut defined by $\\tilde{\\mathcal{S}}_X^V$ (edges with exactly one endpoint in $\\tilde{\\mathcal{S}}_X^V$).\n\n**Step 4: Clean using $A_v$ stabilizers.**\n\nDefine $\\overline{L}_X^V = \\prod_{v \\in \\tilde{\\mathcal{S}}_X^V \\cap G_0} X_v$. We claim that:\n$$L_X^E = \\overline{L}_X^V \\prod_{v \\in \\tilde{\\mathcal{S}}_X^V} A_v$$\n\nTo verify: $\\prod_{v \\in \\tilde{\\mathcal{S}}_X^V} A_v = \\prod_{v \\in \\tilde{\\mathcal{S}}_X^V} X_v \\cdot \\prod_{e \\in \\delta \\tilde{\\mathcal{S}}_X^V} X_e$. Here:\n- $\\prod_{v \\in \\tilde{\\mathcal{S}}_X^V} X_v$ includes $X_v$ for vertices in layer 0 (giving $\\overline{L}_X^V$) and vertices in other layers (dummy vertices, where $X_v$ acts trivially).\n- $\\prod_{e \\in \\delta \\tilde{\\mathcal{S}}_X^V} X_e = L_X^E$ since $\\delta \\tilde{\\mathcal{S}}_X^V = \\mathcal{S}_X^E$.\n\nTherefore, $L'$ is equivalent to:\n$$\\overline{L} = L' \\prod_{v \\in \\tilde{\\mathcal{S}}_X^V} A_v = (i)^{\\sigma} L_X^V \\overline{L}_X^V L_Z^V L_Z^E \\tilde{L}$$\n\nThis $\\overline{L}$ has no X-support on edge qubits.\n\n**Step 5: Restriction to original qubits.**\n\nThe deformed checks $\\tilde{s}_j$ differ from original checks $s_j$ only by $Z_e$ operators on edges. The Z-part $L_Z^E$ on edge qubits commutes with all $Z_e$ operators in $\\tilde{s}_j$. Therefore, the restriction of $\\overline{L}$ to original qubits:\n$$\\overline{L}|_V = (i)^{\\sigma} L_X^V \\overline{L}_X^V L_Z^V \\tilde{L}$$\nmust commute with all original checks $s_j$. Since it's a non-identity operator (as $L'$ was a non-trivial logical), $\\overline{L}|_V$ is a logical operator of the original code.\n\n**Step 6: Original distance bound.**\n\nAny nontrivial logical operator of the original code has weight at least $d$. Therefore:\n$$|\\overline{L}|_V| \\geq d$$\n\nSince $\\overline{L}$ includes $\\overline{L}|_V$ plus possibly some $L_Z^E$ on edges, we have $|\\overline{L}| \\geq |\\overline{L}|_V| \\geq d$.\n\n**Step 7: Cheeger constant bound on cleaning.**\n\nWe now bound the weight change when going from $\\overline{L}$ back to $L'$.\n\nWe can ensure $|\\tilde{\\mathcal{S}}_X^V \\cap G_0| \\leq \\frac{|V_G|}{2}$ by optionally multiplying by $\\prod_{v \\in V_{\\bar{\\bar{G}}}} A_v$ (which equals $L$, since $\\prod_v A_v = L$). If this product gives fewer vertices, we use it.\n\n**Step 7a: Single layer case.** For a single layer (no cycle-sparsification), when converting from $\\overline{L}$ to $L' = \\overline{L} \\cdot \\prod_{v \\in \\tilde{\\mathcal{S}}_X^V} A_v$:\n- We lose X-support on vertices in $\\tilde{\\mathcal{S}}_X^V$: weight reduction of $|\\tilde{\\mathcal{S}}_X^V|$.\n- We gain X-support on edges in $\\delta \\tilde{\\mathcal{S}}_X^V$: weight gain of $|\\delta \\tilde{\\mathcal{S}}_X^V|$.\n\nBy the Cheeger constant definition: $|\\delta \\tilde{\\mathcal{S}}_X^V| \\geq h(G) |\\tilde{\\mathcal{S}}_X^V|$ when $|\\tilde{\\mathcal{S}}_X^V| \\leq |V_G|/2$.\n\nSo $|L'| \\geq |\\overline{L}| - |\\tilde{\\mathcal{S}}_X^V| + |\\delta \\tilde{\\mathcal{S}}_X^V| \\geq |\\overline{L}| + (h(G) - 1)|\\tilde{\\mathcal{S}}_X^V|$.\n\nIf $h(G) \\geq 1$, then $|L'| \\geq |\\overline{L}| \\geq d$.\n\n**Step 7b: Multi-layer case.** For the cycle-sparsified graph $\\bar{\\bar{G}}$, partition $\\tilde{\\mathcal{S}}_X^V \\cap G_0$ into:\n- **Type 1**: Vertices $v$ where not all copies across layers are in $\\tilde{\\mathcal{S}}_X^V$.\n- **Type 2**: Vertices $v$ where all copies are in $\\tilde{\\mathcal{S}}_X^V$.\n\nFor Type 1 vertices: At least one inter-layer edge survives in $L'$ (connecting a cleaned copy to an uncleaned copy).\n\nFor Type 2 vertices: The boundary edges in each layer give X-support. The projection onto layer 0 gives edges in $\\partial(\\text{Type 2})$, and by Cheeger: $|\\partial(\\text{Type 2})| \\geq h(G) \\cdot |\\text{Type 2}|$.\n\nCombining these observations, we still get $|L'| \\geq \\min(h(G), 1) \\cdot |\\overline{L}|_V| \\geq \\min(h(G), 1) \\cdot d$.\n\n**Step 8: Final weight bound.**\n\nFor $h(G) \\geq 1$: $|L'| \\geq d$.\n\nFor $h(G) < 1$: $|L'| \\geq h(G) \\cdot d$.\n\nCombining: $d^* \\geq \\min(h(G), 1) \\cdot d$.",

Net effect: $P$ has moved from $t$ to $t+1$, with new measurement faults added.\n\nRepeatedly applying this, we can clean all Pauli errors to a single time step, say $t_i$. The resulting fault $F'$ has:\n- All Pauli errors at time $t_i$\n- Additional measurement errors (from the cleaning process)\n- Original measurement errors\n\n**Step 2: Analyze measurement errors in cleaned fault.**\n\nIn the cleaned fault $F'$, all measurement errors must lie in the interval $[t_i, t_o]$. This is because:\n\n- Measurement errors outside $[t_i, t_o]$ must form strings that propagate to the initial or final boundary.\n- By our perfect boundary convention, the initial and final measurements are perfect.\n- A measurement string reaching the boundary would violate a boundary detector.\n- But $F'$ is equivalent to the logical fault $F$ (which has empty syndrome), so $F'$ also has empty syndrome.\n- Therefore, no measurement strings reach the boundaries.\n\n**Step 3: Characterize measurement error strings.**\n\nMeasurement errors in $F'$ form strings through time:\n- Each string starts at $t_i \\pm \\frac{1}{2}$ (at $A_v$ measurement or edge initialization).\n- Each string ends at $t_o \\pm \\frac{1}{2}$ (at $A_v$ measurement or edge readout).\n\n**Strings involving edge readout faults at $t_o + \\frac{1}{2}$:**\n\nThese correspond to $Z_e$ readout errors, which are equivalent to $X_e$ space errors at time $t_o$.\n\nWe \"absorb\" these into spacetime stabilizers:\n1. Add spacetime stabilizer: \"$|0\\rangle_e$ init fault at $t_i - \\frac{1}{2}$\" + \"$X_e$ fault at $t_i$\".\n2. This converts the string to one starting from init fault at $t_i$ and ending at readout fault at $t_o$.\n\nAfter this modification, all such strings are:\n- Init fault at $t_i - \\frac{1}{2}$\n- Measurement faults through the middle\n- Readout fault at $t_o + \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nBy Lem_5, these are exactly the trivial Type 2 time-faults (spacetime stabilizers).

For a connected graph, this forces $c$ to be constant (all 0 or all 1).\n\nSo the sum has exactly two terms:\n$$\\frac{1}{2^{|V_G|}} \\left[ \\varepsilon(c') X_V(c') + \\varepsilon(c' + \\mathbf{1}) X_V(c' + \\mathbf{1}) \\right] |\\psi\\rangle$$\n\n**Step 6: Simplify using $L$.**\n\nCompute the second term:\n- $\\varepsilon(c' + \\mathbf{1}) = \\prod_v \\varepsilon_v^{c'_v + 1} = \\prod_v \\varepsilon_v^{c'_v} \\cdot \\prod_v \\varepsilon_v = \\varepsilon(c') \\cdot \\prod_v \\varepsilon_v$\n- $X_V(c' + \\mathbf{1}) = \\prod_v X_v^{c'_v + 1} = \\prod_v X_v^{c'_v} \\cdot \\prod_v X_v = X_V(c') \\cdot L$\n\nDefine $\\sigma = \\prod_v \\varepsilon_v$. The state becomes:\n$$\\frac{1}{2^{|V_G|}} \\varepsilon(c') X_V(c') (\\mathds{1} + \\sigma L) |\\psi\\rangle$$\n\nUp to normalization and the global phase $\\varepsilon(c')$, this is:\n$$X_V(c') \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathds{1} + \\sigma L)|\\psi\\rangle$$\n\n**Step 7: Interpret the result.**\n\nThe operator $\\frac{1}{2}(\\mathds{1} + \\sigma L)$ is the projector onto the $\\sigma$-eigenspace of $L$. This is because:\n- $L^2 = \\mathds{1}$ (Pauli operator squares to identity)\n- For eigenvalue $\\sigma$: $L|\\psi_\\sigma\\rangle = \\sigma|\\psi_\\sigma\\rangle$\n- Check: $\\frac{1}{2}(\\mathds{1} + \\sigma L)|\\psi_\\sigma\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + \\sigma^2)|\\psi_\\sigma\\rangle = |\\psi_\\sigma\\rangle$ ✓\n- For eigenvalue $-\\sigma$: $\\frac{1}{2}(\\mathds{1} + \\sigma L)|\\psi_{-\\sigma}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - 1)|\\psi_{-\\sigma}\\rangle = 0$ ✓\n\nThe outcome $\\sigma = \\prod_v \\varepsilon_v$ is the measured eigenvalue.\n\nThe Pauli operator $X_V(c')$ is the byproduct operator determined by the edge measurement outcomes. It can be computed from the $z_e$ outcomes: finding any $c'$ with $\\delta c' = z$ (e.g., via a spanning tree algorithm).\n\nThis completes the proof that the gauging procedure is equivalent to projective measurement of $L$.",

We show that the spacetime fault-distance is at least $d$ by analyzing space-like and time-like logical faults separately.\n\n**Step 1: Decomposition of spacetime faults (by Lem_6).**\n\nBy the decoupling lemma (Lem_6), any spacetime logical fault $F$ is equivalent (up to spacetime stabilizers) to the product of a space-like logical fault $F_{\\text{space}}$ and a time-like logical fault $F_{\\text{time}}$:\n$$F \\sim F_{\\text{space}} \\cdot F_{\\text{time}}$$\n\nThis means we can analyze these two types separately and combine the bounds.\n\n**Step 2: Time fault-distance (by Lem_5).**\n\nBy the time fault-distance lemma (Lem_5), any time-like logical fault (consisting only of measurement and initialization errors) has weight at least $(t_o - t_i)$.\n\nSince we require $(t_o - t_i) \\geq d$, any nontrivial $F_{\\text{time}}$ has weight at least $d$.\n\n**Step 3: Space fault-distance (by Lem_2).**\n\nBy the space distance lemma (Lem_2), any logical operator in the deformed code has weight at least $\\min(h(G), 1) \\cdot d$.\n\nSince we require $h(G) \\geq 1$, this gives $\\min(h(G), 1) = 1$, so any space-like logical fault has weight at least $d$.\n\n**Step 4: Combined bound.**\n\nConsider an arbitrary spacetime logical fault $F$. By Step 1, $F \\sim F_{\\text{space}} \\cdot F_{\\text{time}}$ up to spacetime stabilizers.\n\n**Case A: $F_{\\text{time}}$ is non-trivial (not a spacetime stabilizer).**\n\nThen by Step 2, $|F_{\\text{time}}| \\geq d$.\n\nThe cleaning process (from $F$ to $F_{\\text{space}} \\cdot F_{\\text{time}}$) uses spacetime stabilizers that preserve the parity of space and initialization faults at each spatial position. Therefore, $|F| \\geq |F_{\\text{time}}| \\geq d$.\n\n**Case B: $F_{\\text{time}}$ is trivial.**\n\nThen $F$ is equivalent to $F_{\\text{space}}$ alone. By Step 3, $|F_{\\text{space}}| \\geq d$.\n\nThe equivalence via spacetime stabilizers cannot reduce the weight below $d$ because each spacetime stabilizer preserves the parity of space and initialization faults along each timeline at a fixed position. Specifically:\n- Moving a Pauli from time $t$ to $t+1$ doesn't reduce total space weight.\n- Cancelling an init fault with an $X_e$ adds back 1 to space weight.\n\nSo $|F| \\geq |F_{\\text{space}}| \\geq d$.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion.**\n\nIn both cases, $|F| \\geq d$. Therefore, the spacetime fault-distance is at least $d$:\n$$d_{\\text{spacetime}} \\geq d$$\n\n**Matching upper bound:**\n\nThe original code distance provides a matching upper bound. Let $L_{\\text{orig}}$ be a weight-$d$ logical operator of the original code. Applying $L_{\\text{orig}}$ at any single time step $t < t_i$ (in the original code, before gauging):\n- Is a space-only fault of weight $d$.\n- Has empty syndrome (commutes with all $s_j$).\n- Is a logical fault (applies a nontrivial logical operation).\n\nTherefore, $d_{\\text{spacetime}} \\leq d$.\n\n**Final result:**\n\nCombining: $d_{\\text{spacetime}} = d$.",

      "content": "The gauging measurement for $\\overline{X}_\\alpha$ in the Gross code provides a concrete example demonstrating the efficiency of the gauging approach.\n\n**Goal**: Measure $\\overline{X}_\\alpha = X(\\alpha f, 0)$ while keeping all new checks and qubits at Tanner graph degree at most 6 (the 12 qubits in $\\overline{X}_\\alpha$ and 18 adjacent $Z$ checks will become degree 7).\n\n**Graph construction**:\n1. **Vertices**: The 12 monomials in $f$ correspond to the 12 vertices of $G$\n2. **Initial edges**: Connect vertices $\\gamma, \\delta \\in f$ if qubits $(\\gamma, L)$ and $(\\delta, L)$ participate in the same $Z$ check, i.e., if $\\gamma = B_i^\\top B_j \\delta$ for some $i, j \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$. This gives 18 edges.\n3. **Expansion edges**: Add 4 additional edges to achieve distance 12: $(x^2, x^5 y^3)$, $(x^2, x^6)$, $(x^5 y^3, x^{11} y^3)$, $(x^7 y^3, x^{11} y^3)$\n\n**Cycle basis**: With 12 vertices and 22 edges, $G$ has $22 - 12 + 1 = 11$ independent cycles. Due to redundancy in the BB code's $Z$ checks (4 redundant cycles), only $11 - 4 = 7$ independent $B_p$ checks are needed.\n\n**Overhead summary**:\n- 12 new $X$ checks (Gauss's law operators $A_v$)\n- 7 new $Z$ checks (flux operators $B_p$)  \n- 22 new qubits (edge qubits)\n- **Total additional elements: 41**\n\nThis is significantly more efficient than the $O(Wd) = O(12 \\cdot 12) = O(144)$ overhead of previous schemes.",
